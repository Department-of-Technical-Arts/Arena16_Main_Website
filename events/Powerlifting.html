Once a year, here at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, we allow this spirit to entirely consume us as we host our annual sports fest, Arena. Arena is one of the biggest sporting festivals conducted in India. The preparation ahead of the fest is grueling, the buildup intense, and participation nothing short of mind blowing as we welcome competitors not only from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh but on a national level as well. This year we plan on hosting the 4th edition of Arena, Arena '16. Keeping up with the ambitions and expectations from a campus such as ours, we are envisioning an Arena bigger, grander and more thrilling than ever before.

The lifter shall be given three attempts for the squat, three for the bench press, and three for the deadlift. Having made his first attempt at a lift, the lifter or his coach must decide upon the weight required for his second attempt. The same procedure is to be used for the second and third attempts on all three lifts. The performance rules are taken from IPF and are stated below:</p>
                                                            <p><strong> </strong></p>
                                                            
                                                            <h2 style = "font-size: 1em;text-transform: none;">Squat:</h2>
                                                            
                                                            <ul>
                                                                <li>The lifter shall face the front of the platform. The bar shall be held horizontally across the shoulders, hands and fingers gripping the bar. The hands may be positioned anywhere on the bar inside and or in contact with the inner collars.</li>
                                                                <li>After removing the bar from the racks, (the lifter may be aided in removal of the bar from the racks by the spotter / loaders) the lifter must move backwards to establish the starting position. When the lifter is motionless, erect (slight deviation is allowable) with knees locked the Referee will give the signal to begin the lift. The signal shall consist of a downward movement of the arm and the audible command “Squat”. Before receiving the signal to “squat” the lifter may make any position adjustments within the rules, without penalty. For reasons of safety the lifter will be requested to “Replace” the bar, together with a backward movement of the arm, if after a period of five seconds he is not in the correct position to begin the lift. The Referee will then convey the reason why the signal was not given.</li>
                                                                <li>Upon receiving the Referee’s signal the lifter must bend the knees and lower the body until the top surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of the knees. Only one decent attempt is allowed. The attempt is deemed to have commenced when the lifters knees have unlocked.</li>
                                                                <li>The lifter must recover at will to an upright position with the knees locked. Double bouncing at the bottom of the squat attempt or any downward movement is not permitted. When the lifter is motionless (in the apparent final position) the Referee will give the signal to rack the bar.</li>
                                                                <li>The signal to rack the bar will consist of a backward motion of the arm and the audible command “Rack”. The lifter must then return the bar to the racks. Foot movement after the rack signal will not be cause for failure. For reasons of safety the lifter may request the aid of the spotter / loaders in returning the bar to, and replacing it in the racks. The lifter must stay with the bar during this process.</li>
                                                            </ul>

The feet must be flat on the floor (as flat as the shape of the shoe will allow). His hands and fingers must grip the bar positioned in the rack stands with a thumbs around grip. This position shall be maintained throughout the lift. Foot movement is permissible but must remain flat on the platform.</li>
                                                                <li>After correctly positioning himself, the lifter may enlist the help of the spotter / loaders in removing the bar from the racks. The lift off if assisted by the spotter / loaders must be at arms length.</li>
                                                                <li>After removing the bar from the racks, with or without the help of the spotter / loaders, the lifter shall wait with straight arms elbows locked for the Referee’s signal. The signal shall be given as soon as the lifter is motionless and the bar properly positioned. For reasons of safety the lifter will be requested to “Re-place” the bar, together with a backward movement of the arm, if after a period of five seconds he is not in the correct position to begin the lift. The Referee will then convey the reason why the signal was not given.</li>
                                                                <li>The signal to begin the attempt shall consist of a downward movement of the arm together with the audible command “Start”.</li>
                                                                <li>After receiving the signal, the lifter must lower the bar to the chest or abdominal area (the bar shall not touch the belt), hold it motionless, after which the Referee will signal the audible command “Press”. The lifter must then return the bar to straight arms length elbows locked. When held motionless in this position the audible command “Rack” shall be given together with a backward motion of the arm. If the bar is lowered to the belt or does not touch the chest or abdominal area, the Referee´s command is “rack”.</li>

                                                                <li>On completion of the lift the knees shall be locked in a straight position and the shoulders back.</li>

                                                                <li>Any rising of the bar or any deliberate attempt to do so will count as an attempt. Once the attempt has begun no downward movement is allowed until the lifter reaches the erect position with the knees locked. If the bar settles as the shoulders come back (slightly downward on completion) this should not be reason to disqualify the lift. </li>
